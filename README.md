# Course Grade Calculator

This project is a JavaScript-based course grade calculator that computes a weighted average from multiple exams and determines the corresponding letter grade and pass/fail status.

The main goal of the project is to practice clean JavaScript logic, function-based structure, and input validation.

## Description

The calculator takes three exam grades from the user:
- Midterm 1
- Midterm 2
- Final exam

Each exam has a predefined weight, and the final average is calculated accordingly. Based on the average score, the program assigns a letter grade and determines whether the student passes the course.

All rules such as exam weights and passing grade are defined as constants to make the code easy to maintain and modify.

## Features

- Weighted grade calculation
- Input validation for grade values (0–100)
- Automatic pass/fail evaluation
- Letter grade conversion system
- Modular and readable JavaScript structure

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- JavaScript (ES6)

No external libraries or frameworks are used.
